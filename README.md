# Horizontal-Distance-Binary-Tree

In a binary tree, find the horizontal distance between 2 nodes at the same level while also counting the position where a sibling node is not present.


For example in the given tree, the distance betweem node 7 and 1 which are at same level is 2 (considering right child of node 2 and left child of node 3)
